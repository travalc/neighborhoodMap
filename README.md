**Neighborhood Map Project**

**About**

This application displays information about top rated local restaurants in the Downtown Portland, Oregon neighborhood. The data about these locations has been retrieved from the Yelp API, and the Google Maps API is used to map the locations and add marker and infowindow functionality. The Knockout JS MVVM framework is utilized to handle asynchronous filtering functionality.

**How to Run**

1. Navigate to the 'dist' folder from the home directory, and open 'index.html' in the browser of your choosing.
2. Restaurant locations should automatically populate the map upon loading.
3. To view information on a location, click the marker, or click on a location name from the list view and the associated marker will animate and display its infowindow.
4. To filter location by name, type in a character or sequence of characters in the input box and results will narrow down to locations containing that character or sequence of characters.
5. If you are viewing on a tablet or smartphone, to access the list view and search box, just click on the hamburger button on the upper right and the list view will drop down into view.
